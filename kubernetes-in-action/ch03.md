## 3.9. Summary


In this chapter, you’ve learned

* How to decide whether certain containers should be grouped together in a pod or not.
* Pods can run multiple processes and are similar to physical hosts in the non-container world.
* YAML or JSON descriptors can be written and used to create pods and then examined to see the specification of a pod and its current state.
* Labels and label selectors should be used to organize pods and easily perform operations on multiple pods at once.
* You can use node labels and selectors to schedule pods only to nodes that have certain features.
* Annotations allow attaching larger blobs of data to pods either by people or tools and libraries.
* Namespaces can be used to allow different teams to use the same cluster as though they were using separate Kubernetes clusters.
* How to use the kubectl explain command to quickly look up the information on any Kubernetes resource.
