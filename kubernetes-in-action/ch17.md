## 17.6. SUMMARY

Hopefully, the information in this chapter has given you an even deeper insight into how Kubernetes works and will help you build apps that feel right at home when deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. The aim of this chapter was to

Show you how all the resources covered in this book come together to represent a typical application running in Kubernetes.
Make you think about the difference between apps that are rarely moved between machines and apps running as pods, which are relocated much more frequently.
Help you understand that your multi-component apps (or microservices, if you will) shouldn’t rely on a specific start-up order.
Introduce init containers, which can be used to initialize a pod or delay the start of the pod’s main containers until a precondition is met.
Teach you about container lifecycle hooks and when to use them.
Gain a deeper insight into the consequences of the distributed nature of Kubernetes components and its eventual consistency model.
Learn how to make your apps shut down properly without breaking client connections.
Give you a few small tips on how to make your apps easier to manage by keeping image sizes small, adding annotations and multi-dimensional labels to all your resources, and making it easier to see why an application terminated.
Teach you how to develop Kubernetes apps and run them locally or in Minikube before deploying them on a proper multi-node cluster.
In the next and final chapter, we’ll learn how you can extend Kubernetes with your own custom API objects and controllers and how others have done it to create complete Platform-as-a-Service solutions on top of Kubernetes.
